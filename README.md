1.Develop immutable Polynomial class to work with the order polynomials in one variable of real type (use sz-array as an internal structure for storing coefficients).
For the developed class we need to:
-override virtual methods of the Object class;
-overload operations allowed for working with polynomials(excluding 
division of a polynomial into a polynomial), including “==” and “! =”.
+ develop unit-tests
2. Implement bubble sorting algorithm for jagged integer array (Don't use System.Array class sorting methods) so that it is possible to order the rows of the matrix:
- in order of increasing (decreasing) the sum of the elements of the rows of the matrix; 
- in ascending (descending) order of the maximum elements of the matrix rows; 
- in ascending (descending) order of the minimum elements of the rows of the matrix;
+ develop unit-tests
